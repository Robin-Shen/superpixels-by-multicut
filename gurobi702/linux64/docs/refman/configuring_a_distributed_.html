Configuring a Distributed Worker Pool</A>
</H2>

<P>
Before your program can perform a distributed optimization task,
you'll need to identify a set of machines to use as your
distributed workers.  Ideally these machines should give very
similar performance.  Identical performance is best, especially for
distributed tuning, but small variations in performance won't hurt
your overall results too much.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Specifying the Distributed Worker Pool</SPAN>

<P>
Once you've identified your distributed worker machines, you'll need
to start <A HREF="gurobi_remote_services.html#sec:RemoteServices">Gurobi Remote Services</A> on these
machines.  Instructions for setting up Gurobi Remote Services can be found in
the
<A NAME="tex2html20"
  HREF="../quickstart/starting_gurobi_remote_ser.html">Gurobi Quick Start Guide</A>.
As noted in the Quick Start Guide, run following command to
make sure a machine is available to be used as a distributed worker:
<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl --server=machine --status
</PRE>
(replace <code>machine</code> with the name or IP address of your machine).
If you see <code>Distributed Worker</code> listed among the
set of available services...
<PRE>
Gurobi Remote Services (version 7.0.0) functioning normally
Available services: Distributed Worker
</PRE>
then that machine is good to go.

<P>
We should reiterate a point that is raised in the Quick Start Guide:
you do not need a Gurobi license to run Gurobi Remote Services on a machine.
Some services are only available with a license (e.g.,
<A HREF="gurobi_compute_server.html#sec:ComputeServer">Compute Server</A>).  However, any
machine that is running Gurobi Remote Services will provide the
Distributed Worker service.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">The Distributed Manager Machine</SPAN>

<P>
Once you have identified a set of distributed worker machines, you'll
need to choose a manager machine.  This is the machine where your
application actually runs.  In addition to building the optimization
model, your manager machine will coordinate the efforts of the
distributed workers during the execution of the distributed algorithm.
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

</DIV>
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
</DIV>
Note that once the distributed algorithm completes, only the manager
retains any information about the solution.  The distributed workers
go off to work on other things.

<P>
You'll need to choose a manager machine that is licensed to run the
distributed algorithms.  You'll see a <code>DISTRIBUTED=</code> line in your
license file if distributed algorithms are enabled.

<P>
Note that, by default, the manager does <EM>not</EM> participate in the
distributed optimization.  It simply coordinates the efforts of the
distributed workers.  If you would like the manager to also act as one
of the workers, you'll need to start Gurobi Remote Services on the manager
machine as well.
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

 ALT="Image distributed2">
</DIV>
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
</DIV>
The workload associated with managing the distributed algorithm is
quite light, so a machine can handle both the manager and worker role
without degrading performance.

<P>
Note that we only allow a machine to act as manager for a single
distributed job.  If you want to run multiple distributed jobs
simultaneously, you'll need multiple manager machines.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Specifying the Distributed Worker Pool</SPAN>

<P>
If you'd like to invoke a distributed algorithm from your application,
you'll need to provide the names of the distributed worker machines.
You do this by setting the
<A HREF="workerpool.html#parameter:WorkerPool">WorkerPool</A> parameter (refer to
the <A HREF="parameters.html#sec:Parameters">Gurobi Parameter</A> section for
information on how to set a parameter).  The parameter should be set
to a string that contains a comma-separated list of either machine
names or IP addresses.  For example, you might use the following in
your <code>gurobi_cl</code> command line:
<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl WorkerPool=server1,server2,server3 ...
</PRE>

<P>
If you have set up an access password on the distributed
worker machines, you'll need to provide it through the
<A HREF="workerpassword.html#parameter:WorkerPassword">WorkerPassword</A> parameter.
All machines in the worker pool must have the same access password.

<P>
Note that providing a list of available workers is strictly a
configuration step. Your program won't actually use any of the
distributed algorithms unless it specifically requests them.
Instructions for doing so are next.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Requesting A Distributed Algorithm</SPAN>

<P>
Once you've set the <code>WorkerPool</code> parameter to
the appropriate value, your final step is to set the
<A HREF="concurrentjobs.html#parameter:ConcurrentJobs">ConcurrentJobs</A>,
<A HREF="distributedmipjobs.html#parameter:DistributedMIPJobs">DistributedMIPJobs</A>, or
<A HREF="tunejobs.html#parameter:TuneJobs">TuneJobs</A> parameter.  These
parameters indicate how many distinct distributed worker
jobs you would like to start.
For example, if you set <code>TuneJobs</code> to 2 in <code>grbtune</code>...
<PRE>
&gt; grbtune WorkerPool=server1,server2 TuneJobs=2 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...you should see the following output in the log...
<PRE>
Started distributed worker on server1
Started distributed worker on server2

Distributed tuning: launched 2 distributed worker jobs
</PRE>
This output indicates that two jobs have been launched, one on machine
<code>server1</code> and the other on machine <code>server2</code>.  These two
jobs will continue to run until your tuning run completes.

<P>
Similarly, if you launch distributed MIP...
<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl WorkerPool=server1,server2 DistributedMIPJobs=2 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...you should see the following output in the log...
<PRE>
Started distributed worker on server1
Started distributed worker on server2

Distributed MIP job count: 2
</PRE>

<P>
Note that, in most cases, each machine runs one distributed worker job
at a time.  Distributed workers are allocated on a first-come,
first-served basis, so if multiple users are sharing a set of
distributed worker machines, you should be prepared for the
possibility that some or all of them may be busy when the manager
requests them.  The manager will grab as many as it can, up to the
requested count.  If none are available, it will return an error.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Compute Server Considerations</SPAN>

<P>
If you have one or more
<A HREF="gurobi_compute_server.html#sec:ComputeServer">Gurobi Compute Servers</A>,
you can use them for distributed
optimization as well.  Compute Servers offer a lot more flexibility
than distributed workers, though, so they require a bit of additional
explanation.

<P>
The first point you should be aware of is that one Compute Server can
actually host multiple distributed worker jobs.  Compute Servers allow
you to set a limit on the number of jobs that can run simultaneously.
Each of those jobs can be a distributed worker.  For example,
if you have a pair of Compute Servers, each with a job limit of 2,
then issuing the command...
<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl DistributedMIPJobs=3 WorkerPool=server1,server2 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...would produce the following output...
<PRE>
Started distributed worker on server1
Started distributed worker on server2
Started distributed worker on server1
</PRE>
Compute Server assigns a new job to the machine with the most
available capacity, so assuming that the two servers are otherwise
idle, the first distributed worker job would be assigned to
<code>server1</code>, the second to <code>server2</code>, and the third to
<code>server1</code>.

<P>
Another point to note is that, if you are working in a Compute Server
environment, it is often better to use the Compute Server itself as
the distributed manager, rather than the client machine.  This is
particularly true if the Compute Server and the workers are physically
close to each other, but physically distant from the client machine.
In a typical environment, the client machine will offload the Gurobi
computations onto the Compute Server, and the Compute Server will then
act as the manager for the distributed computation.

<P>
To give an example, running following command on machine <code>client1</code>:
<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl --server=server1 WorkerPool=server1,server2 DistributeMIPJobs=2 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...will lead to the following sequence of events...

<UL>
<LI>The model will be read from the disk on <code>client1</code> and passed to Compute Server <code>server1</code>.
</LI>
<LI>Machine <code>server1</code> will act as the manager of the distributed optimization.
</LI>
<LI>Machine <code>server1</code> will start two distributed worker jobs, one that
also runs on <code>server1</code> and another that runs on <code>server2</code>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Compute Server provides load balancing among multiple machines, so it
is common for the user to provides a list of available servers when a
Gurobi application starts.  We'll automatically copy this list into the
<code>WorkerPool</code> parameter.  Of course, you can change the value of
this parameter in your program, but the default behavior is to draw
from the same set of machines for the distributed workers.  Thus,
the following command would be equivalent to the previous command:
<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl --server=server1,server2 DistributedMIPJobs=2 misc07.mps
</PRE>

<P>
Please refer to the
<A HREF="gurobi_compute_server.html#sec:ComputeServer">next section</A> section for more information
on using a Gurobi Compute Server.
