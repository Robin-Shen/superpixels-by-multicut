MPS format
</H2>

<P>
MPS format is the oldest and most widely used format for storing math
programming models.  There are actually two variants of this format in
wide use.  In fixed format, the various fields must always start at
fixed columns in the file.  Free format is very similar, but the
fields are separated by white space instead of appearing in specific
columns.  One important practical difference between the two formats
is in name length.  In fixed format, row and column names are exactly
8 characters, and spaces are part of the name.  In free format, names
can be arbitrarily long (although the Gurobi reader places a 255
character limit on name length), and names may not contain spaces.
The Gurobi MPS reader reads both MPS types, and recognizes the format
automatically.

<P>
Note that any line that begins with the <code>*</code> character is a
comment.  The contents of that line are ignored.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">NAME section</SPAN>

<P>
The first section in an MPS format file is the <code>NAME</code> section.
It gives the name of the model:
<PRE>
NAME        AFIRO
</PRE>
In fixed format, the model name starts in column 15.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ROWS section</SPAN>

<P>
The next section is the <code>ROWS</code> section.  It begins with the word
<code>ROWS</code> on its own line, and continues with one line for each row
in the model.  These lines indicate the constraint type (<code>E</code> for
equality, <code>L</code> for less-than-or-equal, or <code>G</code> for
greater-than-or-equal), and the constraint name.  In fixed format, the
type appears in column 2 and the row name starts in column 5.  Here's
a simple example:
<PRE>
ROWS
 E  R09
 E  R10
 L  X05
 N  COST
</PRE>
Note that an <code>N</code> in the type field indicates that the row is a
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">free row</SPAN>.  The first free row is used as the objective
function.

<P>
If the file includes multiple <code>N</code> rows, each including a
priority, weight, relative, and absolute tolerance field, then each
such row is treated as an objective in a multi-objective model.  The
additional fields must appear after the name, separated by spaces.
For example, the following would capture a pair of objectives, where
the first has priority 2 and the second has priority 1 (and both have
identical weights, and relative and absolute tolerances):
<PRE>
 N  OBJ0 2 1 0 0
 N  OBJ1 1 1 0 0
</PRE>
Please refer to the
<A HREF="multiple_objectives.html#sec:MultipleObjectives">multi-objective</A>,
<A HREF="objnpriority.html#attr:ObjNPriority">ObjNPriority</A>,
<A HREF="objnweight.html#attr:ObjNWeight">ObjNWeight</A>,
<A HREF="objnreltol.html#attr:ObjNRelTol">ObjNRelTol</A>, and
<A HREF="objnabstol.html#attr:ObjNAbsTol">ObjNAbsTol</A> sections for
information on the meanings of these fields. Note that all objectives
of a multi-objective optimization problem have to be linear.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">COLUMNS section</SPAN>

<P>
The next and typically largest section of an MPS file is the
<code>COLUMNS</code> section, which lists the columns in the model and the
non-zero coefficients associated with each.  Each line in the columns
section provides a column name, followed by either zero, one, or two
non-zero coefficients from that column.  Coefficients are specified
using a row name first, followed by a floating-point value.  Consider
the following example:
<PRE>
COLUMNS
    X01         X48           .301   R09         -1.
    X01         R10          -1.06   X05          1.
    X02         X21            -1.   R09          1.
    X02         COST           -4.
</PRE>
The first line indicates that column <code>X01</code> has a non-zero in row
<code>X48</code> with coefficient <code>.301</code>, and a non-zero in row
<code>R09</code> with coefficient <code>-1.0</code>.  Note that multiple lines
associated with the same column must be contiguous in the file.

<P>
In fixed format, the column name starts in column 5, the row name for
the first non-zero starts in column 15, and the value for the first
non-zero starts in column 25.  If a second non-zero is present, the
row name starts in column 40 and the value starts in column 50.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Integrality markers</SPAN>

<P>
The <code>COLUMNS</code> section can optionally include integrality
markers.  The variables introduced between a pair of markers must take
integer values.  The beginning of an integer section is marked by
an <code>INTORG</code> marker:
<PRE>
    MARK0000  'MARKER'                 'INTORG'
</PRE>
The end of the section is marked by an <code>INTEND</code> marker:
<PRE>
    MARK0000  'MARKER'                 'INTEND'
</PRE>
The first field (beginning in column 5 in fixed format) is the name of
the marker (which is ignored).  The second field (in column 15 in
fixed format) must be equal to the string <code>'MARKER'</code> (including
the single quotes).  The third field (in column 40 in fixed format) is
<code>'INTORG'</code> at the start and <code>'INTEND'</code> at the end of the
integer section.

<P>
The <code>COLUMNS</code> section can contain an arbitrary number of such
marker pairs.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">RHS section</SPAN>

<P>
The next section of an MPS file is the <code>RHS</code> section, which
specifies right-hand side values.  Each line in this section may
contain one or two right-hand side values.
<PRE>
RHS
    B           X50           310.   X51          300.
    B           X05            80.   X17           80.
</PRE>
The first line above indicates that row <code>X50</code> has a right-hand
side value of <code>310</code>, and <code>X51</code> has a right-hand side value
of <code>300</code>.  In fixed format, the variable name for the first
bound starts in column 15, and the first bound value starts in column
25.  For the second bound, the variable name starts in column 40 and
the value starts in column 50.  The name of the RHS is specified in
the first field (column 5 in fixed format), but this name is ignored
by the Gurobi reader.  If a row is not mentioned anywhere in the
<code>RHS</code> section, that row takes a right-hand side value of
<code>0</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">BOUNDS section</SPAN>

<P>
The next section in an MPS file is the optional <code>BOUNDS</code>
section.  By default, each variable takes a lower bound of 0 and an
infinite upper bound.  Each line in this section can modify the lower
bound of a variable, the upper bound, or both.  Each line indicates a
bound type (in column 2 in fixed format), a bound name (ignored), a
variable name (in column 15 in fixed format), and a bound value (in
columns 25 in fixed format).  The different bound types, and the
meaning of the associate bound value, are as follows:
<BR><TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">LO</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">lower bound</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">UP</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">upper bound</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">FX</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">variable is fixed at the specified value</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">FR</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">free variable (no lower or upper bound)</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">MI</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">infinite lower bound</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">PL</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">infinite upper bound</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">BV</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">variable is binary (equal 0 or 1)</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">LI</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">lower bound for integer variable</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">UI</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">upper bound for integer variable</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">SC</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">upper bound for semi-continuous variable</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Consider the following example:
<PRE>
BOUNDS
 UP BND         X50            80.
 LO BND         X51            20.
 FX BND         X52            30.
</PRE>
In this <code>BOUNDS</code> section, variable <code>X50</code> gets a upper
bound of <code>80</code> (lower bound is unchanged at <code>0</code>,
<code>X51</code> gets a lower bound of <code>20</code> (infinite upper bound is
unchanged), and <code>X52</code> is fixed at <code>30</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">QUADOBJ section</SPAN>

<P>
The next section in an MPS file is the optional <code>QUADOBJ</code>
section, which contains quadratic objective terms.  Each line in this
section represents a single non-zero value in the lower triangle of
the Q matrix.  The names of the two variable that participate in the
quadratic term are found first (starting in columns 5 and 15 in fixed
format), followed by the numerical value of the coefficient (in column
25 in fixed format).  By convention, the Q matrix has an implicit
one-half multiplier associated with it.  Here's an example containing
three quadratic terms:
<PRE>
QUADOBJ
    X01       X01       10.0
    X01       X02       2.0
    X02       X02       2.0
</PRE>
These three terms would represent the quadratic function
<!-- MATH
 $(10 X01^2 + 2 X01 * X02 + 2 X02 * X01 + 2 X02^2)/2$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="357" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img119.png"
 ALT="$(10 X01^2 + 2 X01 * X02 + 2 X02 * X01 + 2 X02^2)/2$"></SPAN>
(recall that the single off-diagonal term actually represents
a pair of non-zero values in the symmetric Q matrix).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">QCMATRIX section</SPAN>

<P>
The next section in an MPS file contains zero or more <code>QCMATRIX</code>
blocks.  These blocks contain the quadratic terms associated with the
quadratic constraints.  There should be one block for each quadratic
constraint in the model.

<P>
Each <code>QCMATRIX</code> block starts with a line that indicates the name
of the associated quadratic constraint (starting in column 12 in fixed
format).  This is followed by one of more quadratic terms.  Each term
is described on one line, which gives the names of the two
involved variables (starting in columns 5 and 15 in fixed format),
followed by the coefficient (in column 25 in fixed format).
For example:
<PRE>
QCMATRIX   QC0
    X01       X01       10.0
    X01       X02       2.0
    X02       X01       2.0
    X02       X02       2.0
</PRE>
These four lines describe three quadratic terms: quadratic constraint
<code>QC0</code> contains terms <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img120.png"
 ALT="$10 X01^2$"></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img121.png"
 ALT="$4 X01*X02$"></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img122.png"
 ALT="$2 X02^2$"></SPAN>.
Note that a <code>QCMATRIX</code> block must contain a symmetric matrix, so
for example an <code>X01*X02</code> term must be accompanied by a matching
<code>X02*X01</code> term.

<P>
Linear terms for quadratic constraint <code>QC0</code> appear in the
<code>COLUMNS</code> section.  The sense and right-hand side value appear in
the <code>ROWS</code> and <code>RHS</code> sections, respectively.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">PWLOBJ section</SPAN>

<P>
The next section in an MPS file is the optional <code>PWLOBJ</code> section,
which contains piecewise-linear objective functions.  Each line in
this section represents a single point in a piecewise-linear objective
function.  The name of the associated variable appears first (starting
in column 4), followed by the x and y coordinates of the point
(starting in columns 14 and 17).  Here's an example containing two
piecewise-linear expressions, for variables <code>X01</code> and <code>X02</code>,
each with three points:
<PRE>
   X01       1  1
   X01       2  2
   X01       3  4
   X02       1  1
   X02       3  5
   X02       7  10
</PRE>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">SOS section</SPAN>

<P>
The next section in an MPS file is the optional <code>SOS</code> section.
The representation for a single SOS constraint contains one line that
provides the type of the SOS set (<code>S1</code> for SOS type 1 or
<code>S2</code> for SOS type 2, found in column 2 in fixed format) and the
name of the SOS set (column 5 in fixed format) of the SOS set.  This
is followed by one line for each SOS member.  The member line gives
the name of the member (column 5 in fixed format) and the associated
weight (column 15 in fixed format).  Here's an example containing two
SOS2 sets.
<PRE>
SOS
 S2 sos1
    x1           1
    x2           2
    x3           3
 S2 sos2
    x3           1
    x4           2
    x5           3
</PRE>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Indicator Constraint section</SPAN>

<P>
The indicator constraint section is optional in the MPS format. It
starts with the keyword <code>INDICATORS</code>. Each subsequent line of the
indicator section starts with the keyword <code>IF</code> (placed at column
2 in fixed format) followed by a space and a row name (the row must
have already been defined in the <code>ROWS</code> section). The line
continues with a binary variable (placed at column 15 in fixed format)
and finally a value <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> (placed at column 25 in fixed
format).

<P>
Here a simple example:
<PRE>
INDICATORS
 IF row1      x1        0
 IF row2      y1        1
</PRE>

<P>
The first indicator constraint in this example states that <code>row1</code>
has to be fulfilled if the <code>x1</code> takes a value of <code>0</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">General Constraint section</SPAN>

<P>
An MPS file may contain an optional section that captures more general
constraints. The general constraint section starts with the
keyword <code>GENCONS</code>.

<P>
Each general constraint in this section starts with a general constraint
type specifier, such as <EM>MIN</EM>, <EM>MAX</EM>, <EM>OR</EM>, <EM>AND</EM>,
or <EM>ABS</EM> (found in column 2 in fixed format). Optionally a space and
a name may follow.

<P>
What follows this line depends on the general constraint type.  All
general constraints start with the so-called resultant variable,
placed on it's own line (starting at column 5 in fixed format). For
<EM>MIN</EM> or <EM>MAX</EM> constraints, a non empty list of variables
or values follows this (each on its own line).  For <EM>OR</EM> and
<EM>AND</EM> constraints, a list of binary variables follows (each on
its own line). For <EM>ABS</EM> constraints, one additional variable
follows (on its own line).  In fixed format all of these variables or
values are placed at column 5.

<P>
The other general constraint type, the <EM>INDICATOR</EM> constraint,
appears in a separate <code>Indicator</code> section, which is described
above.

<P>
The following shows an example of a general constraint section:
<PRE>
GENCONS
 MAX gc0
    r1
    x1
    x2
    x10
    0.7
 MIN gencons1
    r2

</PRE>

<P>
For more information, consult the <A HREF="constraints.html#subsubsection:GeneralConstraints">general constraint
discussion</A>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ENDATA</SPAN>

<P>
The final line in an MPS file must be an <code>ENDATA</code> statement.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Additional notes</SPAN>

<P>
Note that in the Gurobi optimizer, MPS models are always written in
full precision.  That means that if you write a model and then read it
back, the data associated with the resulting model will be bit-for-bit
identical to the original data.
