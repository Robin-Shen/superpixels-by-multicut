The optimization model</A>
</H2>

<P>
In order to formulate this as an optimization problem, we'll need to
do three things.

<UL>
<LI>First, we'll need to define the decision variables.
The goal of the optimization is to choose values for these variables.
</LI>
<LI>Second, we'll define a linear objective function.  This is the function we'd like to minimize (or maximize).
</LI>
<LI>Third, we'll define the linear
constraints.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The Gurobi Optimizer will consider all assignments of
values to decision variables that satisfy the specified linear
constraints, and return one that optimizes the stated objective
function.

<P>
The variables in this problem are quite straightforward.  The solver
will need to decide how many of each coin to produce.  It is
convenient to give the decision variables meaningful names.  In this
case, we'll call the variables <EM>Pennies</EM>, <EM>Nickels</EM>,
<EM>Dimes</EM>, <EM>Quarters</EM>, and <EM>Dollars</EM>.  We'll also
introduce variables that capture the quantities of the various
minerals actually used by the solution.  We'll call them
<EM>Cu</EM>, <EM>Ni</EM>, <EM>Zi</EM>, and <EM>Mn</EM>.

<P>
Recall that the objective of our optimization problem is to maximize
the total dollar value of the coins produced.  Each penny produced
is worth 0.01 dollars, each nickel is worth 0.05 dollars, etc.  This
gives the following linear objective:
<PRE>
  maximize: 0.01 Pennies + 0.05 Nickels + 0.1 Dimes + 0.25 Quarters + 1 Dollars
</PRE>

<P>
The constraints of this model come from the fact that producing a coin
consumes certain quantities of the available minerals, and the supplies
of those minerals are limited.  We'll capture these relationships in
two parts.  First, we'll create an equation for each mineral that
captures the amount of that mineral that is consumed.  For copper,
that equation would be:
<PRE>
  Cu = 0.06 Pennies + 3.8 Nickels + 2.1 Dimes + 5.2 Quarters + 7.2 Dollars
</PRE>
The coefficients for this equation come from the earlier coin
specification table: one penny uses 0.06g of copper, one nickel
uses 3.8g, etc.

<P>
The model must also capture the available quantities of each mineral.
If we have 1000 grams of copper available, then the constraint would be:
<PRE>
  Cu &lt;= 1000
</PRE>
For our example, we'll assume we have 1000 grams of copper and 50
grams of the other minerals.

<P>
There is actually one other set of constraints that must be captured
in order for our model to accurately reflect the physical realities of
our problem.  While a dime is worth 10 cents, half of a dime isn't
worth 5 cents.  The variables that capture the number of each coin
produced must take integer values.

<P>
