Developing for Compute Server
</H3>

<P>
With only a few exceptions, using Gurobi Compute Server requires no
changes to your program.  This section covers the exceptions.  We'll
talk about program robustness issues that may arise specifically
in a Compute Server environment, and we'll give a full list of the
Gurobi features that aren't supported in Compute Server.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Coding for Robustness</SPAN>

<P>
Client-server computing introduces a few robustness situations that
you wouldn't face when all of your computation happens on a single
machine.  Specifically, by passing data between a client and a server,
your program is dependent on both machines being available, and on an
uninterrupted network connection between the two systems.  The queuing
and failover capabilities of Gurobi Compute Server can handle the vast
majority of issues that may come up, but you can take a few additional
steps in your program if you want to achieve the maximum possible
robustness.

<P>
The one scenario you may need to guard against is the situation where
you lose the connection to the server while the portion of your
program that builds and solves an optimization model is running.
Gurobi Compute Server will automatically route queued jobs to another
server, but jobs that are running when the server goes down are
interrupted (the client will receive a
<A HREF="error_codes.html#sec:ErrorCodes">NETWORK</A> error).
If you want your program
to be able to survive such failures, you will need to architect it in
such a way that it will rebuild and resolve the optimization model in
response to a <code>NETWORK</code> error.  The exact steps for doing so are
application dependent, but they generally involve encapsulating the
code between the initial Gurobi environment creation and the last
Gurobi call into a function that can be reinvoked in case of an error.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Features Not Supported in Compute Server</SPAN>

<P>
As noted earlier, there are a few Gurobi features that are not
supported in Compute Server.  We've mentioned some of them already,
but we'll give the full list here for completeness.  You will need to
avoid using these features if you want your application to
work in a Compute Server environment.

<P>
The unsupported features are:

<UL>
<LI><B>Lazy constraints:</B> While we do provide <code>MIPSOL</code>
  callbacks, we don't allow you to add lazy constraints to cut
  off the associated MIP solutions.
</LI>
<LI><B>User cuts:</B> The <code>MIPNODE</code> callback isn't supported,
  so you won't have the opportunity to add your own cuts.
  User cuts aren't necessary for correctness, but applications
  that heavily rely on them may experience performance issues.
</LI>
<LI><B>Multi-threading within a single Gurobi environment:</B>
  This isn't actually supported in Gurobi programs in general,
  but the results in a Compute Server environment are sufficiently
  difficult to track down that we wanted to mention it again here.
  All models built from an environment share a single socket
  connection to the Compute Server.  This one socket can't
  handle multiple simultaneous messages.  If you wish to
  call Gurobi from multiple threads in the same program, you
  should make sure that each thread works within its own
  Gurobi environment.
</LI>
<LI><B>Advanced simplex basis routines:</B> The C routines that work
  with the simplex basis (
  <A HREF="c_grbfsolve.html#routine:GRBFSolve">GRBFSolve</A>,
  <A HREF="c_grbbsolve.html#routine:GRBBSolve">GRBBSolve</A>,
  <A HREF="c_grbbinvcolj.html#routine:GRBBinvColj">GRBBinvColj</A>,
  <A HREF="c_grbbinvrowi.html#routine:GRBBinvRowi">GRBBinvRowi</A>, and
  <A HREF="c_grbgetbasishead.html#routine:GRBgetBasisHead">GRBgetBasisHead</A>) are not
  supported.
</LI>
</UL>
