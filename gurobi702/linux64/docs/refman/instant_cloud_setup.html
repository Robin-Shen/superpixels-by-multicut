Instant Cloud Setup
</H2>

<P>
As noted previously, cloud configuration is done via the
<A NAME="tex2html25"
  HREF="https://cloud.gurobi.com">Instant Cloud Manager</A>.
The client program requests that a cloud machine be launched, but the
Instant Cloud Manager determines exactly how to respond to that
request.

<P>
One essential concept when configuring your Instant Cloud license is
the notion of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cloud pool</SPAN>.  Pools allow you to create multiple
configurations within a single cloud license.  For example, you may
set up one pool for jobs in the US and another for jobs in Europe, or
one for short-running jobs and another for long-running jobs, or one
for single-machine jobs and another for distributed parallel jobs.
For each of the available cloud configuration options (which will be
discussed below), you can select different values for different pools.
Every license always has a default pool, which comes pre-configured
with what we consider to be reasonable default values.  Thus, you
always have the option of ignoring cloud pools and simply using the
default pool if you don't need multiple configurations.

<P>
The main things that a user may want to configure on the Instant Cloud
website are the idle shutdown time, the number of machines to launch,
the number of distributed workers to launch, the machine region, and
the machine type.  These can take different values in different pools.

<P>
The idle shutdown time is a vital concept in the Instant Cloud.  When
a client program requests a cloud server, it takes some time
(typically less than 2 minutes) to launch that server.  Rather than
forcing client programs to incur this delay each time they run, the
Gurobi Instant Cloud leaves a server running until is has been idle
for the specified idle shutdown time.  In this way, later client
programs may find a cloud server already available.  You can set this
to a small value if you want your server to shut down immediately
after your job finishes, or to a very large value if you want your
server to always be available.

<P>
Another configuration option is the number of machines associated with
the pool.  Gurobi Compute Server automatically handles queuing and
load balancing between servers, so launching multiple machines allows
you to distribute the work of many simultaneous client programs among
them.  A pool can also be configured to launch any number of
distributed workers, if you want to use distributed computing.

<P>
Cloud machines can be launched in multiple geographic regions,
including the US, Europe, Asia, and South America.  You should visit
the website to see the full list.  We offer several options for
machine type, although we've chosen what we believe is the best
general-purpose machine for running Gurobi as the default, so you are
unlikely to want to change this setting.
