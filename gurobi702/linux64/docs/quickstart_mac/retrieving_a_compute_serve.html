Retrieving a Compute Server license
</H3>

<P>
If you have purchased one or more Gurobi Compute Server licenses,
you'll need to perform a few setup steps in order to start your
Compute Servers.  Once started, client machines will be able to
offload the work of solving an optimization model onto these servers.
The clients and the Compute Servers can run any mix of supported
operating systems.  Thus, for example, multiple Mac machines could
submit jobs to a pair of Compute Servers, one running Windows and the
other running Mac OS.  Any machine that can reach the Compute Server(s)
over your network can be a client (including the Compute Servers
themselves).

<P>
Once you've chosen a machine to act as a Compute Server, you'll need
to run the <code>grbgetkey</code> command on that machine to retrieve your
Gurobi license key.  Note that the machine must be connected to the
Internet in order to run this command. An Internet connection is not
required after you have obtained your license key.

<P>
If your computer isn't connected to the Internet or if your network
security system does not allow the command below to function,
we also offer a
manual license key process.  You'll find manual instructions at the
bottom of the License Detail page (by following the link labeled
<EM>click here for additional instructions</EM>).

<P>
The exact <EM>grbgetkey</EM> command to run for a specific license is
indicated at the bottom of the License Detail page (e.g.,
<code>grbgetkey 253e22f3-...</code>).  We recommend that you use copy-paste
to copy the entire <code>grbgetkey</code> command from our website and paste
it into a Terminal window.

<P>
The <code>grbgetkey</code> program passes identifying information about
your machine back to our website, and the website responds with your
license key.  Once this exchange has occurred, <code>grbgetkey</code> will
ask for the name of the directory in which to store your license
key file (<code>gurobi.lic</code>).  You should see a prompt that looks
like this:
<PRE>
---------------------
Saving license key...
---------------------

In which directory would you like to store the Gurobi license key file?
[hit Enter to store it in /home/jones]:
</PRE>

<P>
You can store the license key file anywhere, but we strongly recommend
that you accept the default location by hitting <EM>Enter</EM>. Setting
up a non-default location is error-prone and a frequent source of
trouble.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Using a non-default license file location</SPAN>

<P>
When you run the Mac version of the Gurobi Optimizer, it will look for
the <code>gurobi.lic</code> key file in three different default locations.
It will always look in your home directory.  In addition, Gurobi
Optimizer 7.0.2will also look in <code>/Library/gurobi</code> and
<TT>/Library/gurobi702</TT>.

<P>
If you would like to use a non-default license key file
location, you can do so by setting environment variable
<code>GRB_LICENSE_FILE</code> to point to the license key file.  <EM>  Important note: the environment variable should point to the license
  key file itself, not to the directory that contains the file.</EM>

<P>
On Mac systems, you can set the optional <code>GRB_LICENSE_FILE</code>
environment variable through <code>environment.plist</code>, as explained in
<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/EnvironmentVars.html">Apple's Runtime configuration Guidelines</A>.

<P>
Once you have followed the steps above and have obtained
a license key file, your next step is to
